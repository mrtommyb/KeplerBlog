The K2 project have updated the dates we expect to release K2 data to the [MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/). These revised dates are available from the [K2 fields information website](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/Fields.shtml). Of particular note is our plan to release Campaign 5 data on Nov 20, 2015 and Campaign 6 data on Dec 28, 2015. Our ongoing plan is to have data available less than three months after downlink from the spacecraft. Users should note that these dates are our best estimates and are subject to change.
