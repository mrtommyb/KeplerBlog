The K2 mission, the repurposing of the prolific planet-hunting Kepler spacecraft, is an achievement that spans well beyond the NASA team and across the science and engineering communities. The resulting new scientific observation opportunities are a testament to ingenuity and teamwork, and we would like to help bring attention to your great work.
 
While all results are scientifically significant, there are some that hold the added luster of public appeal. At the basic level, public appeal can be qualified as 'firsts' (the first Earth-sized planet); has a tie to popular culture (Kepler-16b or "Tatooine" and is also a 'first'); or sparks curiosity (catching a supernova before the explosion, or a disintegrating planet). These are the hooks that grab the attention of the public and spurs additional learning. A news hook can be obvious but can require discussion to ferret out the story.
 
If you have a science result that may have public appeal, and will soon be accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, please contact [Michele Johnson](mailto:michele.johnson@nasa.gov). Of most immediate interest are those results that will be announced at the IAU General Assembly in August.
