The September 18 deadline for early registration, hotel reservation, & abstract submission for the [K2SciCon](http://lcogt.net/k2scicon/) is just a few days away.
The K2 Science Conference is hosted by the LCOGT and will celebrate the science from the first year of the K2 mission in sunny Santa Barbara. Hotel rooms are currently available at the government rate ($151) - a fantastic deal for Santa Barbara. However after Sept 18 the room rate will jump to over $300 per night. The registration fee also jumps to $425 after that date.

All K2 users are welcome to present early scientific results from all areas of research, from our own Solar System and exoplanets to young stars and distant galaxies. The organizing committee are particularly interested in hearing those in the asteroseismology community and also encourage contributions on results from the Kepler prime mission and the upcoming TESS mission. 

Questions and to be added to the email list: [k2scicon-loc@lcogt.net](mailto:k2scicon-loc@lcogt.net)

The conference will take place Nov. 2-5, 2015 in Santa Barbara, CA at the Fess Parker hotel.
