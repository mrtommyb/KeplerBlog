Target pixel files, light curves, and full frame images for [Campaign 4](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/GuestInvestigationsC04.shtml) are available for download from the [K2 data archive at MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/). In Campaign 4, 15,853 long cadence and 122 short cadence targets were observed. Additionally, large circular pixel masks were collected that cover bright 3-5 mag B-stars and red giants in the Hyades and Pleiades open clusters.  Data for these nine stars are listed by custom aperture number at MAST, rather than by EPIC number.  A Trans-Neptunian Object (2002 KY14) was also observed, and 1340 pixel masks were collected to cover the trajectory of this moving target.

Data release notes for Campaign 4 are available at [http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/C4drn.shtml](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/C4drn.shtml). Users are encouraged to read the release notes in full and note in particular the following:

* Due to the dust clouds near the Pleiades, the background removal near the cluster has larger than normal residuals. 
* There are [887 stellar targets](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/K2drn/C4/C4_reduced_ap_targets.txt) that have light curves with more noise than expected, as they were likely created with non-optimal apertures.  This is due to incompatibility between K2 roll motion and determination of photometric optimal apertures.
* A fraction (23.8%) of stellar targets have light curves generated from apertures that are larger than optimal because they have lower than expected flux compared to their Kepler magnitudes in the EPIC.
* A different group of stars have higher than expected flux, also resulting in non-optimal apertures.
