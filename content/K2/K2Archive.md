To assist folks with planning their K2 related activities (follow-up observing, graduate student work, etc.) [we have made available the anticipated dates](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/Fields.shtml) that we will archive pixel level and light curve data at [the MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/) for all K2 campaigns through to C13. These dates are subject to change due of programmatic activities and may come in or slip out. We will keep these dates updated as we are able.
