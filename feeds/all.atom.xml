&lt;p&gt;Our pointing has been significantly better than our conservative pointing assumptions we used when we built our pixel cost algorithms. The result of this is that we can observe about double the number of targets from Campaign 5 onwards compared with Campaign 4 and earlier. The increase is from about 15,000 total to around 30,000 total. Unfortunately, the telemetry data to determine that we were able to do this was no available in time for the K2 GO Cycle 2 proposal deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this affect you? You may wish to consider submitting larger target lists than in previous cycles in any Cycle 3 proposals you are submitting. Now, as always there is a caveat here that you should not propose more target than you can justify but please be aware that the cost of a target is now lower.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Due date for K2 Guest Observer Cycle 3 Step-1 Proposal Fast Approaching</title><link href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/blog/due-date-for-k2-guest-observer-cycle-3-step-1-proposal-fast-approaching.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-05-29T05:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2015-05-29:blog/due-date-for-k2-guest-observer-cycle-3-step-1-proposal-fast-approaching.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The K2 Guest Observer Cycle 3 proposal call is observations of targets in Campaigns 8 and 10.

&lt;p&gt;Dr Geert Barentsen joins us from the University of Hertfordshire in the UK. Geert's background is in the exploitation of photometry from wide-area surveys. In Hertfordshire he leads the data processing of two projects which aim to map our own Milky Way in unprecedented detail: &lt;a href="http://www.iphas.org"&gt;IPHAS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.vphas.eu"&gt;VPHAS+&lt;/a&gt;. He also teaches a university's programming and statistics class, and is a contributor to the &lt;a href="http://www.astropy.org"&gt;AstroPy&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geert earned his doctorate at the Queen's University of Belfast in 2012 where he studied star formation using narrow-band photometry. Prior to his PhD, he obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Antwerp in Belgium, after which he gained professional experience in data science at the European Space Agency in The Netherlands and the Royal Meteorological Institute in Belgium. In his spare time, he studies the activity of meteor showers using data collected by amateur astronomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Knicole Colón leaves a postdoctoral role at Lehigh University as a member of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilodegree_Extremely_Little_Telescope"&gt;KELT project&lt;/a&gt; to join us at Kepler. Her expertise is in the discovery and characterization of transiting exoplanets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student at the University of Florida, Knicole demonstrated the capability of OSIRIS on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) for exoplanet science.  After earning her doctorate in 2012, she gained postdoctoral experience at the University of Hawaii and Lehigh University.  There, she focused on the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with narrow-band photometry and in the confirmation of planets around bright stars discovered by the KELT transit survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geert will start his new role in June 2015 and Knicole will join us a month later in July.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>K2 Microlensing Campaign Draft Agenda Now Available</title><link href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/blog/k2-microlensing-campaign-draft-agenda-now-available.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-04-24T06:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2015-04-24:blog/k2-microlensing-campaign-draft-agenda-now-available.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2MicrolensingWorkshop/Agenda/"&gt;draft agenda&lt;/a&gt; is now available for the &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2MicrolensingWorkshop/"&gt;K2 Microlensing Workshop&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The motivations for holding this workshop are two-fold: Firstly to provide an opportunity for interactive planning for the K2 Microlensing Experiment amongst NASA, the K2 project and the scientific community; and secondly to serve as a pre-proposal discussion opportunity in advance of the submission of K2 Microlensing Science Team proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K2 project staff will describe the observing plan and operating procedures for up-linking target lists, down-linking the observed data and the time-line for archiving products. NASA HQ and K2 staff will present information regarding the proposal process, possible avenues for investigation, and funding. We are also inviting attendees to present information valuable in the planning and preparation for the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop will begin at 9.00am PST on Thursday May 7 and end at 12.00pm PST on Friday May 8, 2015. The venue will be the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California.

This is a milestone release because it utilizes the first uniform processing of the entire Kepler data set and it represents a first attempt at fully automating the dispositioning process so as to produce a uniformly vetted catalog of planetary candidates (PCs) and false positives (FPs). This is being done via the use of "robovetters" - sophisticated decision trees that utilize a set of targeted metrics to mimic the decision-making process. While all KOIs in the Q1-Q17 DR24 KOI table are given dispositions, work on the robovetters is not yet complete. Thus, before the table is closed more KOIs will be added and dispositions will change.
